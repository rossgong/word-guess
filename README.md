# Everybody Loves Raymond Word Guess

Look nowhere else fot the best word guess game all around. Help the two best characters of all time duke it out by helping raymond guess what debra is thinking! Ray might be an idiot but *you are not*.

##What this game is under the covers
This is a very simple HTML game with very basic responsiveness to help me learn the very basics of javascript. Includes basic user interaction, custom animation, very crude graphics, and basic HTML/css. This is based of a simple, but open ended, prompt for a themed hangman-esque game. I thought I would use the oppurtunity to teach myself some responsive graphics giving the whole game a more baked in, but not like you are just interacting with a web-pade feel.

##Using this repository
This is a closed project on my end but anyone is free to fork the code and use it to their own will.
